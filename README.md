# Memory-Design
Design of 4X4 16-bit SRAM Memory Array Using Cadence Virtuoso tool.

## About
The project involves the design of a 4X4 16-bit SRAM Memory Array using *Cadence Virtuoso* built using *GPDK 180nm* Technology.

**SRAM(Static Random Access Memory )** 
* Is a type of random access memory (RAM) that is volatile, meaning retains data bits in its memory as long as the  power is being supplied.
* In the *Memory Hierarchy* ,SRAM is often used for cache memory, which sits between the CPU and the main memory(DRAM).
* Unlike DRAM, SRAM does not require refreshing, making it faster and more energy-efficient.
* SRAM comes with a trade-off, it is more expensive and less dense compared to DRAM.
