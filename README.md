### **SRAM(Static Random Access Memory )** 
* Is a type of random access memory (RAM) that is volatile, meaning retains data bits in its memory as long as the  power is being supplied.
* In the *Memory Hierarchy* ,SRAM is often used for cache memory, which sits between the CPU and the main memory(DRAM).
* Unlike DRAM, SRAM does not require refreshing, making it faster and more energy-efficient.
* SRAM comes with a trade-off, it is more expensive and less dense compared to DRAM.

### **Applications of SRAM**

SRAM is widely used in various applications due to its speed, low power consumption, and suitability for cache memory. Some key applications include:

1. **Cache Memory:** SRAM is commonly used as cache memory in CPUs to provide fast access to frequently used data.

2. **Register Files:** SRAM is used in register files within microprocessors for storing temporary data during computation.

3. **Networking Devices:** SRAM is employed in networking devices for buffering and storing routing tables.

4. **Embedded Systems:** SRAM finds applications in embedded systems, providing quick access to critical data.
